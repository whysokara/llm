## About LLM's

You must have used ChatGPT for all your work, but how do you make your own ChatGPT? These are what we call large language models (LLMs). 

An LLM is a neural network designed to understand, generate, and respond to human-
like text. These models are deep neural networks trained on massive amounts of text
data, sometimes encompassing large portions of the entire publicly available text on
the internet.
